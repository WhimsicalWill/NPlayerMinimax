// Game Name: Go
// InitialState: Empty board; Player 0 moves first
// ValidMoves: Players can place stones on any empty intersections that aren't suicide or violate the Ko/SuperKo rules.
// TransitionFunction: Players place a stone on a chosen intersection.
// WinCondition: The game ends when both players pass consecutively and the player with the most territory wins.
// TieCondition: The game is a tie if both players have the same amount of territory.
